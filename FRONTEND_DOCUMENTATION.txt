FRONTEND DOCUMENTATION (Tamilaka News React App)

Overview
This Frontend is a React + Redux application for creating, managing, and publishing news content. It has three main flows:
1) Admin + operations UI to configure site structure, pages, districts, and users.
2) News creation and editing flow for individual articles.
3) Newspaper layout editor and live preview that renders the final site using the saved layout and content.

Entry Point
- `Frontend/src/main.jsx` bootstraps React, wraps the app with Redux Provider, and mounts `App`.
- `Frontend/src/store.js` sets up Redux, registers slices, and persists the entire Redux state to localStorage on every change.

Routing (defined in `Frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- `/` -> `Login`
- `/AdminHome` -> `AdminHome`
- `/Newsbund` -> `Newsbund` (news list)
- `/Newsupload` -> `Templatepage` (news editor)
- `/Newspaper` -> `NewsPaperM` (public-facing newspaper)
- `/preview/:id` -> `PreviewPage` (article preview)
- `/editpaper` -> `Editpaper` (layout editor)
- `/Tryout` -> `Tryout` (drag-drop demo)
- `/adminop` -> `Adminop` (admin operations panel)

Note: Some links rendered by `AdminHome` are not routed in `App.jsx` (for example `/admin-overview`, `/users`, `/settings`, `/notifications`, `/logout`). These currently lead to empty routes unless added later.

Redux State (high-level)
- `newsform` slice: stores all news items, current news item, layout choice, comments, translation state.
- `admin` slice: stores page list and nav configuration (top nav + side nav) and district list.
- `editpaper` slice: stores the newspaper layout tree (pages -> containers -> slots -> nested containers -> sliders -> lines).
- `users` slice: stores local admin users for Manage Users UI.

Data Flow Summary
- Create or edit news in `Templatepage` -> saves to `newsform.allNews`.
- `Newsbund` lists `newsform.allNews` -> opens `Templatepage` for editing or `/preview/:id` for preview.
- `Editpaper` uses `editpaper` slice to build the layout, and `NewsFilter` supplies news items for drag-drop into slots.
- `NewsPaperM` renders the layout using `PagePreview` and reads data from `editpaper` + `newsform` + `admin` slices.
- `Adminop` modifies `admin` pages/districts and syncs them into `editpaper` pages via `syncPagesFromAdmin`.

Pages (Routed)
1. Login (`Frontend/src/Pages/Login.jsx`, route `/`)
Purpose: Basic sign-in UI with local state. Simulates login and routes to `/AdminHome` after a delay.
Connections: Always navigates to `AdminHome` on submit. No backend auth.
State usage: Local state only.

2. AdminHome (`Frontend/src/Pages/AdminHome.jsx`, route `/AdminHome`)
Purpose: Admin dashboard shell with sidebar and quick actions.
Connections: Links to `/Newsbund`, `/editpaper`, `/Newspaper`, `/adminop` and several non-routed links (see routing note).
State usage: None; UI is static.

3. Newsbund (`Frontend/src/Pages/Newsbund.jsx`, route `/Newsbund`)
Purpose: News listing and management hub.
State usage: Reads `newsform.allNews`. Uses `setCurrentNews` and `deleteNews` actions.
Connections:
- Upload button and card click -> `/Newsupload` (opens Templatepage).
- Preview button -> `/preview/:id`.
- Delete -> removes from `newsform` (moves to trash in slice).

4. Templatepage (`Frontend/src/Pages/TemplatePage/Templatepage.jsx`, route `/Newsupload`)
Purpose: Full news editor. Builds the content layout for a single article.
Key behavior:
- Uses `Newsform` for metadata (headline, one-liner, author, thumbnail, zonal category).
- Drag and drop paragraph, image, and video boxes onto a main canvas.
- Add “container overlays” to organize content into grid layouts.
- Supports per-article settings (height, padding, grid columns, gap) and hidden elements (thumbnail/author/zonal display).
State usage:
- Reads `newsform.currentNews` and `newsform.MLayout`.
- Saves updates via `saveNews` or `updateNews` in `newsformslice`.
Connections:
- Receives `currentNews` from `Newsbund` for editing.
- Saved data is rendered later in `/preview/:id` and can appear in layout containers.

5. PreviewPage (`Frontend/src/Pages/PreviewPage/PreviewPage.jsx`, route `/preview/:id`)
Purpose: Full article reading view and comments.
Key behavior:
- Renders article metadata and content boxes (paragraph/image/video) plus container overlays.
- Includes theme toggle, font-size controls, and comment section.
- Uses Newspaper UI components (Navbarr, Sidebar, Footer) for a real-site experience.
State usage:
- Reads `newsform.allNews` for article data.
- Uses `newsform.MLayout` for side news layout.
- Adds comments via `addComment` in `newsformslice`.
Connections:
- Navigated to from Newsbund cards, many container components, and search suggestions in Navbarr/Sidebar.

6. Editpaper (`Frontend/src/Pages/Editpaper/Editpaper.jsx`, route `/editpaper`)
Purpose: Newspaper layout editor (drag-drop layout builder).
Key behavior:
- PageEditor panel allows switching pages, adding containers, sliders, lines, presets, polls, and video blocks.
- NewsFilter panel lets you drag news into slots by category (from `newsform` slice).
- EditableContainer supports nested containers and sliders, plus per-container header and spacing settings.
State usage: Heavy use of `editpaper` slice (pages, containers, slots, sliders, lines, presets).
Connections:
- Uses `admin` slice pages/districts to build page tabs in PageEditor.
- Output is rendered in `/Newspaper` via PagePreview.

7. NewsPaperM (`Frontend/src/Pages/Newspaper/NewsPaperM.jsx`, route `/Newspaper`)
Purpose: Public-facing newspaper view rendered from the layout editor.
Key behavior:
- Navbarr + Sidebar allow page switching, search, language toggle, and district selection.
- PagePreview renders the selected page from `editpaper` slice.
State usage:
- Reads `admin` slice for nav structure and districts.
- Reads `editpaper` slice for layout.
- Reads `newsform` slice for news content.
Connections:
- Clicking a news card navigates to `/preview/:id`.
- Page switches are local state but use admin config to populate nav/side items.

8. Adminop (`Frontend/src/Pages/AdminOperationPage/Adminop.jsx`, route `/adminop`)
Purpose: Admin operations hub with its own sidebar and tools.
Key behavior:
- Handle Pages: manage pages, districts, and top nav positions.
- Website Layout: set the global layout preference (`newsform.MLayout`).
- Manage Users: add/edit/delete users in local Redux.
State usage:
- Uses `admin` slice to modify pages/districts and nav ordering.
- Syncs `admin` -> `editpaper` via `syncPagesFromAdmin`.
- Uses `users` slice for user management.
Connections:
- Acts as the primary admin tooling hub from AdminHome.

9. Tryout (`Frontend/src/Tryout.jsx`, route `/Tryout`)
Purpose: Standalone drag-drop demo not connected to the main app data model.
Connections: None.

Non-routed or Legacy Pages
- `Frontend/src/Pages/Trash.jsx` appears incomplete and is not routed.
- `Frontend/src/Pages/Newspaper/Pages/Main.jsx` and `Politics.jsx` provide static layouts and are not used in current routing.
- `Frontend/src/Trash/*` contains older or experimental components (not wired in routes).

Utilities and Supporting Files

- `Frontend/src/Pages/Newspaper/Containers_/timeFun.js`: Formats time values for display.
- `Frontend/src/Pages/Newspaper/Components/getTodayInTamil.js`: Generates the Tamil date string used in the navbar.

Important Connections and Behavior Notes
- Admin pages/districts (admin slice) drive navigation in Newspaper Navbarr/Sidebar and also determine the pages available in the Editpaper layout editor.
- The Editpaper layout (editpaper slice) is the single source of truth for the Newspaper page rendering.
- News content (newsform slice) is the single source of truth for all article display in Newsbund, PreviewPage, and Newspaper containers.
- LocalStorage persistence means all slices are saved and restored between reloads.

Known Gaps (from code behavior)
- Some routes linked in `AdminHome` do not exist in the router yet.
- `Pages/Trash.jsx` appears incomplete and is not wired into routing.
- `AdminSelectors` include references to `state.admin.allDistricts`, but districts are actually stored inside the last item of `allPages`.
